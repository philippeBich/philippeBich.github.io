Hi! I am **Philippe Bich**, a third (and final) year PhD student at Politecnico di Torino with a research focus on **Low-Energy Deep Neural Networks** (DNNs). After earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I continued my academic journey with a Master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering (110/110 cum laude) from Politecnico di Torino, where I developed a **strong interest in Computer Vision and Robotics**. During my Master's thesis at the _Boston University Robotics Lab_ under the supervision of _Prof. John Baillieul_, I decided to pursue a PhD under the guidance of _Prof. Gianluca Setti_. **My primary research area has become the compression/pruning of neural models for computer vision**, aiming to enable their deployment on resource-constrained edge and **robotic platforms**. I am also **particularly interested in Event-based cameras**, which are **low-power neuromorphic sensors** and offer significant advantages for real-time applications by capturing dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and low latency. I have published papers in several prestigious conferences and journals, including **ICRA** and **CVPR**, and I am a **finalist of the CVPR 2024 Event-based Eye-tracking Challenge**.
