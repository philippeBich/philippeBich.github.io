**After one year we have news from IEEE TNNLS!**ðŸ“° After a major review, our paper **"A Multiply-And-Max/min Neuron Paradigm for Aggressively Prunable Deep Neural Networks"** is now under minor review with many positive feedbacks! ðŸŽ‰ You can find a preprint of this work [here](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/661582/articles/681537-a-multiply-and-max-min-neuron-paradigm-for-aggressively-prunable-deep-neural-networks)!
